### !!! DO NOT MERGE THIS BRANCH WITH MAIN !!!

Only merge the following (if there are any updates):

- scenes\PLayer.tscn
- scripts\player\player.gd

This is another project entirely. Since I didn't have access to this Team Rocket repo, I 
just made a new Project and did the player movement state chart. When I did get access to 
this repo, I cloned the Team Rocket repo, made a new branch for player movement, and 
literally overwrote this new branch with my existing project.
