This folder is just an EXPERIMENTAL folder to try out a new:
	ingredient, recipe and dish creation structure.

HOW TO USE THIS TO MAKE A NEW RECIPE

1) Make a new dish type resource
2) Put base buffs on dish type
3) Make a new dish and put its name, ingredient types and buffs
4) Slot the dish under a dish type
5) Whatever ingredient types you used for that dish, ensure you have options for it
6) If no option, make ingredient of that type
7) Add whateverr buffs or names to that ingredient
8) If you want an entirely new ingredient type, make one as part of the enum
9) Add the new dish type to the dish crafter
10) Create a dish crafter and call its craft_dish method
11) In the argument put the list of ingredients, you will have to instantiate them

Using the ingredients crafter is about the same, no need for the dish parts is all

test_DCF.tscn is a showcase of all of this!
